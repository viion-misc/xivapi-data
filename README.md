## Setup

Install dependencies via composer:

- `composer install`


## Run the interactive console

Open the repository in command prompt/terminal and from root run:

- `php bin/console xiv`

An interactive console will appear. Choose the options you wish. You can automate this by providing a comma seperated list of numbers for each option, eg:

- `php bin/console xiv 1,4,3,5,6`

This will run the options: 1, 4, 3, 5, 6 in that order.
